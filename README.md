# Vacuum-Cleaner-World-Java
Two classes in JAVA that implement a vacuum cleaner. Using depth first search, we set the direction (up, down, left, right)
and the position from where the vacuum stars cleaning. (x, y axis)
Also using a hashset where I save the positions already cleaned.
1 is considered dirty and 0 is considered cleaned.
